Network Kit Logging Interceptor helps you to log HTTP request and response data during development. You can monitor your API call easily.

Usage
-----
You can add the interceptor while building the `HttpClient` object,
```kotlin
val loggingInterceptor = HttpLoggingInterceptor()
loggingInterceptor.level = HttpLoggingInterceptor.Level.BASIC
val httpClient: HttpClient = HttpClient.Builder()
    .addInterceptor(loggingInterceptor)
    .build()
```
The Logging Interceptor has four levels of logging: **Basic, Body, Headers, and None.** You can choose the level of logging based on your needs.

`BASIC` – Logs request and response lines. 
`BODY` – Logs request and response lines and their respective headers and bodies (if present). You can use this log level to get the response body data.
`HEADERS` – Logs request and response lines and their respective headers.
`NONE` – No logs. You can use this log level for production.

Redact-Header
-----
The data generated by the interceptor may contain sensitive information such as Authorization or Cookie and the contents of request and response bodies. It may cause the leaking the sensitive information in production deployments. This data should only be logged in a controlled way or in a non-production environment.

You can redact headers that contain sensitive information by calling `redactHeader("HeaderName")`.

```kotlin
loggingInterceptor.redactHeader("Authorization")
loggingInterceptor.redactHeader("User-Session")
```
